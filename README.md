# turn-it-around


### Project Goals
This project will provide Turn It Around with a platform for audience growth, user resource database growth, and allow them to better communicate their mission of anti-bullying awareness.

### Project Summary
The WordPress.com Special Projects Team will work with partner Turn It Around to plan, develop, test, refine and launch the initial version of the new Turn It Around website using WordPress.

### Basic Approach and Timeline
Partner has a virtual fundraiser event on October 25th. Turn It Around would like to reveal the new site at the event.
We'll be taking a two-phase approach:
- Phase 1 / Oct. 25 launch: New design, content and membership functionality.
- Phase 2 / Nov. 22 launch: Additional WooCommerce features and chatbot functionality.
